# Package_Delivery
Stated Problem:
The objective of this program is to establish efficient routes and distribution plans for package deliveries within the Western Governor University Parcel Service (WGUPS), utilizing Python 3.11. The task involves handling 40 packages scheduled for delivery by the end of the day, each with unique delivery deadlines. Challenges include limit of three trucks and two available drivers for delivery, accounting for delays in package arrival, adhering to specific truck loading constraints, and accommodating special requirements like grouped package deliveries and designated trucks for certain packages. To address these challenges a systematic approach is proposed.

Proposed Solution and Approach:
Our approach consists of several strategic steps aimed at optimizing package deliveries for the Western Governor University Parcel Service (WGUPS): 
1. Truck Prioritization: The three available trucks will be prioritized based on package delivery deadlines. High priority(truck1) for packages with a delivery deadline of 9:00 AM, medium priority(truck2) with delivery deadline of 10:30 AM, and low priority(truck3) for packages with deliver deadline by EOD which will be defined as 5: 00 PM. This prioritization will for the foundation for efficient route planning and distribution. 
2. Nearest Neighbor Greedy Algorithm: The core of our approach lies in the implementation of the self-adjusting heuristic nearest neighbor algorithm. The nearest neighbor algorithm is used to create an initial delivery route for each truck. It starts from the hub (starting point) and iteratively selects the nearest package or destination to visit next. This process continues until all packages are assigned to the route. 
The nearest neighbor algorithm is relatively simple and quick but may not always result in the most optimal route. In the context of the code, the nearest neighbor algorithm is used to create an initial route for each truck, which is then further optimized using the two-opt algorithm and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
3. Two-Opt Greedy Algorithm: The two-opt algorithm is then applied to the initial routes created by the nearest neighbor algorithm. This algorithm attempts to improve the route by iteratively swapping pairs of edges to eliminate intersections and reduce the overall route distance. It helps refine the initial routes and make them more optimal.
After applying the two-opt algorithm to the initial routes, Dijkstra's algorithm is used once again to calculate the shortest paths for the refined routes. This ensures that the routes remain optimized even further after the two-opt optimization.
4. Dijkstra's Shortest Path Greedy Algorithm: Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm used to find the shortest paths from a source vertex (hub) to all other vertices (package delivery locations) in a weighted graph. In the code, Dijkstra's algorithm is used to calculate the shortest route from the hub to each package's delivery location, considering the distances between vertices (locations). 
Dijkstra's algorithm ensures that the calculated routes are truly optimized in terms of minimizing the distance traveled. This algorithm provides a more accurate measure of the shortest routes compared to the initial routes generated by the nearest neighbor algorithm and two-opt algorithm. The final total distance calculated.
